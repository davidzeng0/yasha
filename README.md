const {Source, TrackPlayer, VoiceConnection} = require('yasha');

client.on('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {
	if(message.content == 'play a song!'){
		// see docs/VoiceConnection.md
		var connection = await VoiceConnection.connect(message.member.voice.channel);

		// see docs/TrackPlayer.md
		var player = new TrackPlayer();
